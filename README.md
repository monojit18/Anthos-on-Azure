# Bourn and Nourish on GCP, Living on Azure

## Introduction

Today majority of the customers are looking towards multiple CSPs/Vendors to run their Cloud workloads at sccale and also run, manage, operate them seamlessly - whenver and wherever!

Single-cloud architecture is highly dependent on specific CSPs and their tools, services. Anthos provies a single pane of glass to manage workloads from multiple clouds with a unified management and configuration plane.

Customers having containerized workloads that need to run on multiple clouds viz. AWS, Azure - can now be deployed, managed, configured from GCP Console or CLI.

You can manage your Kubernetes clusters on AWS and Azure from the Google Cloud console. With [Connect gateway](https://cloud.google.com/anthos/multicluster-management/gateway#why_use_the_connect_gateway), you can connect to your clusters in any cloud with your Google Cloud identity for authentication.

From this page, you can view documentation for Anthos clusters on AWS, Anthos clusters on Azure, and the Anthos Multi-Cloud API. For more information about other Anthos clusters environments, see [Anthos clusters](https://cloud.google.com/anthos/clusters/docs).
